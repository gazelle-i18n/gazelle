	<h3>Further Rules</h3>
	<div class="box pad">
		<p>
			The modification of clients to bypass our client requirements (spoofing) is explicitly forbidden. People caught doing this will be instantly and permanently banned. This is your only warning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The use of clients or proxies which have been modified to report incorrect stats to the tracker (cheating) is not allowed, and will result in a permanent ban. Additionally, your information will be passed on to representatives of other trackers, where you are liable to be banned as well. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The testing of unstable clients by developers is not allowed unless approved by a staff member.
