	<div class="box pad" style="padding:10px 10px 10px 20px;">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Do not defy the expressed wishes of the staff.
			</li>
			<li>
				Access to this website is a privilege, not a right, and it can be taken away from you for any reason.
			</li>
			<li>
				Staff decisions are final. Arguing about our decisions is hazardous for your account.
			</li>
			<li>
				One account per person per lifetime. Anyone creating additional accounts will be banned.
			</li>
			<li>
				Avatars must not exceed 256kB or be vertically longer than 400px. Avatars must be safe for work, be entirely unoffensive and not contain any nudity or religious imagery. Use common sense.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not post our .torrent files on other sites. Every .torrent file has your personal passkey embedded in it. The tracker will automatically disable your account if you share your torrent files with others. You will not get your account back. This doesn't prohibit you sharing the content on other sites, just the .torrent file.
			</li>
			<li>
				Any torrent you are seeding to this tracker must only have our tracker's URL in it. Adding another tracker's URL will cause incorrect data to be sent to our tracker, and will lead to you getting disabled for cheating. 
			</li>
			<li>
				This is a torrent site which promotes sharing amongst the community. If you are not willing to give back to the community what you take from it, this site is not for you. In other words, we expect you to have an acceptable share ratio. If you download a torrent, please, seed the copy you have until there are sufficient people seeding as well before you stop.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not browse the site using proxies or TOR. The site will automatically alert us. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Asking for invites to any site is not allowed anywhere on What.CD or our IRC network. Invites may be offered in the Invites forum, and nowhere else.
			</li>
			<li>
				Trading and selling invites is strictly prohibited, as is offering them in public - this includes on any forum which is not a class-restricted section on an invitation-only torrent site.
			</li>
			<li>
				Trading, selling, sharing, or giving away your account is prohibited as well. PM a mod to disable you if you no longer want it.
			</li>
			<li>
				You're completely responsible for the people you invite. If your invitees are caught cheating or trading/selling invites, not only will they be banned, so will you. Be careful who you invite. Invites are a precious commodity.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be careful when sharing an IP or a computer with a friend if they have (or have had) an account. From then on your accounts will be inherently linked and if one of you violates the rules, both accounts will be disabled along with any other accounts linked by IP. This rule applies to logging into the site.
			</li>
			<li>
				Attempting to find or exploit a bug in the site code is the worst possible offense you can commit. We have automatic systems in place for monitoring these activities, and committing them will result in the banning of you, your inviter, and your inviter's entire invite tree. 
			</li>
			<li>
				We're a community. Working together is what makes this place what it is. There are well over a thousand new torrents uploaded every day and sadly the staff aren't psychic. If you come across something which violates a rule, report it! Ignoring it is only damaging the community.
			</li>
			<li>
				We respect the wishes of other sites here, as we wish for them to do the same. Please refrain from posting links or full names of sites that want not to be mentioned.
			</li>
