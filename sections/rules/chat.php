	<h3 id="forums">Forum Rules</h3>
	<div class="box pad" style="padding:10px 10px 10px 20px;">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Many forums (Tutorials, The Library, etc.) have their own set of rules. Make sure you read and take note of these rules before you attempt to post in one of these forums.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't use all capital letters, excessive !!! (exclamation marks) or ??? (question marks), it seems like you're shouting!
			</li>
			<li>
				No lame referral schemes. This includes freeipods.com, freepsps.com, or any other similar scheme in which the poster gets personal gain from users clicking a link.
			</li>
			<li>
				No asking for money for any reason whatsoever. We don't know or care about your friend who lost everything, or dying relative who wants to enjoy their last few moments alive by being given lots of money.
			</li>
			<li>
				No advertising your uploads. 
			</li>
			<li>
				No posting music requests in forums, there's a request link on the top bar, please use that instead.
			</li>
			<li>
				No flaming, be pleasant and polite. Don't use offensive language, and don't be confrontational for the sake of confrontation.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't point out or attack other members' share ratios. A higher ratio does not make you better than someone else.
			</li>
			<li>
				Try not to ask stupid questions. A stupid question is one that you could have found the answer to yourself with a little research, or one that you're asking in the wrong place. If you do the basic research suggested (i.e., read the rules/wiki) or search the forums and don't find the answer to your question, then go ahead and ask. Staff/FLS are not here to hand-feed you the answers you could have found on your own with a little bit of effort.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be sure you read all the stickies.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use descriptive and specific subject lines. This helps others decide whether your particular words of wisdom relate to a topic they care about.
			</li>
			<li>
				Try not to post comments that don't add anything to the discussion. When you're just cruising through a thread in a leisurely manner, it's not too annoying to read through a lot of "hear, hear"'s and "I agree"'s. But if you're actually trying to find information, it's a pain in the neck. So save those one-word responses for threads that have degenerated to the point where none but true aficionados are following them any more.
				<p>
					Or short: NO spamming
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Refrain from quoting excessively. When quoting someone, use only the portion of the quote that is absolutely necessary. This includes quoting pictures!
			</li>
			<li>
				No posting of requests for serials or cracks. No links to warez or crack sites in the forums.
			</li>
			<li>
				No political or religious discussions. These types of discussions lead to arguments and flaming users, something that will not be tolerated. The only exception to this rule is The Library forum, which exists solely for the purpose of intellectual discussion and civilized debate.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't waste other people's bandwidth by posting images of a large file size.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be patient with newcomers. Once you have become an expert, it is easy to forget that you started out as a newbie too.
			</li>
			<li>
				No requesting invites to any sites anywhere on the site or IRC. Invites may be <strong>offered</strong> in the invite forum, and nowhere else.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not include pornographic or semi-pornographic material in your posts.
			</li>
			<li>
				No language other than English is permitted in the forums. If we can't understand it, we can't moderate it. 
			</li>

	<h3 id="irc">IRC Rules</h3>
	<div class="box pad" style="padding:10px 10px 10px 20px;">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Staff have the final decision, if they say stop and you continue, expect at least to be banned from the IRC server. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Be respectful to IRC Operators and Administrators. These people are site staff who volunteer their time for little compensation. They are there for the benefit of all and to aid in conflict resolution, do not waste their time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not link shock sites or anything NSFW (not safe for work) without a warning. If in doubt, ask a staff member in #what.cd-help about it.
			</li>
			<li>
				Excessive swearing will get you kicked, keep swearing to a minimum.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not leave your Caps Lock on all the time. It gets annoying, and you will likely get yourself kicked.
			</li>
			<li>
				No arguing. You can't win an argument over the internet, so you're just wasting your time trying.
			</li>
			<li>
				No prejudice, especially related to race, religion, politics, ethnic background, etc. It is highly suggested to avoid this entirely.
			</li>
			<li>
				Flooding is irritating and will merit you a kick. This includes but is not limited to: automatic now playing scripts, pasting large amounts of text, and multiple consecutive lines with no relevance to the conversation at hand.
			</li>
			<li>
				Impersonation of other members (particularly staff members) will not go unpunished. If you are uncertain of a user's identity, check their vhost.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spamming is strictly forbidden. This includes but is not limited to: personal sites, online auctions, and torrent uploads.
			</li>
			<li>
				Obsessive annoyance both to other users and staff will not be tolerated.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't PM, DCC, or Query anyone you don't know or have never talked to without asking, this applies specifically to staff.
			</li>
			<li>
				No language other than English is permitted in the official IRC channels. If we can't understand it, we can't moderate it. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The offering, selling, trading and giving away of invites to this or any other site on our IRC network is <strong>strictly forbidden</strong>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Read the topic before asking questions.</strong>
