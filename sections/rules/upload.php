	<div class="box pad" style="padding:10px 10px 10px 20px;">
		<p>The upload rules below appear overwhelmingly long and detailed at first glance. However, the length is for explaining the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each rule is in <strong>bold text</strong> before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the <a href="#Index">Index</a>. The corresponding <a href="#"><strong>&uarr;</strong></a> (move one level up) and <a href="#Index">rule section links</a> (move down into the document) help provide quick navigation.</p>		
		<p>If you are still unsure of what a rule means before uploading something, PLEASE ask at any of the following forms of site user support: <a href="staff.php">First-Line Support</a>, <a href="forums.php?action=viewforum&amp;forumid=8">The Help Forum</a>, <a href="wiki.php?action=article&amp;name=IRC">#what.cd-help on IRC</a>. Privately message a <a href="staff.php">moderator</a> on the site if other support has directed you to a moderator for resolution or support has been unhelpful in your case. If you find any dead links in the upload rules, let a <a href="staff.php">staff member</a> know so it can be promptly fixed.</p>

They are allowed on the site. It is highly recommended you provide proof in at least one of the following forms: a) digital photo proving ownership of the CD or hi-res scan of the CD top b) a rip log c) confidence of 2 or more verification with AccurateRip in the rip log or after ripping (with <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=53583">arcue.pl</a> / <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=60440">arcue.exe</a>, <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=CueTools">CUE Tools</a>, or equivalent) in your <em>Release description</em>. You must provide this proof if requested by staff.

			<li id="r2.1.3"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.3">2.1.3.</a> <strong>Music releases must have an average bitrate of at least 192kbps regardless of the format.</strong> <u>Exceptions</u>: The following VBR encodes may go under the 192kbps limit: LAME -V2, -V1, -V0, APS, APX, MP3 192 (VBR), Ogg Vorbis -q8 (~256 VBR), and AAC ~192 (VBR) to AAC ~256 (VBR) releases.
				<ul> 
					<li id="r2.1.3.1"><strong>Recommendations for MP3 encoding:</strong> We strongly encourage the latest Hydrogenaudio recommended stable release of LAME (currently 3.98.3) for MP3 encoding. You can find out more information about LAME and its options at the <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME">Hydrogenaudio Wiki</a>.
					</li>
					<li id="r2.1.3.2"><strong>Recommendations for Ogg Vorbis encoding:</strong> We strongly encourage the use of newer and well-maintained Ogg Vorbis encoders such as Aoyumi's aoTuV series of encoders. However, as long as the encoder satiates the requirements for Ogg Vorbis presets and average bitrates on this site, you may use any encoder you prefer. For more information on aoTuV and other Ogg Vorbis encoders, <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis#Recommended_Vorbis_Encoders">read the wiki page at Hydrogenaudio</a>.
					</li>

					<li id="r2.1.3.3"><strong>Recommendations for AAC encoding:</strong> Encoding object types LC/Low Complexity and HE/High Efficiency are strongly encouraged. LC/Low Complexity is recommended for music uploads. HE/High Efficiency is optimized for lower bitrates, which makes it ideal for comedy or audio books. You may use other encoding profiles and object types, but they will not be compatible on most portable players, media players, and systems. Find out more information <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=AAC">here</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.4"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.4">2.1.4.</a> <strong>Bitrates must accurately reflect encoder presets or average bitrate of the audio files.</strong> You are responsible for supplying correct format and bitrate information on the upload page. All audio torrents must have accurate labeling for the encoder settings used or the average bitrate. This means that lossy formats such as MP3, AAC, DTS, and Ogg Vorbis cannot have a bitrate of "lossless." Conversely, FLAC cannot have fixed bitrates or xxx(VBR) bitrates. Non-LAME formats and MP3 encoders cannot use LAME's VBR switches (-V0, -V1, -V2, etc). If you are uploading a non-LAME MP3, determine the average bitrate of the files. Then select "Other" for bitrate and type in xxx (VBR) where "xxx" is the bitrate you found. Some tools to determine the bitrates of audio files are <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Audio_Identifier.htm">Audio Identifier</a>, <a href="http://www.burrrn.net/?page_id=6">Mr. Questionman</a> (<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Other-AUDIO-Tools/Mr-QuestionMan.shtml">mirror</a>), or <a href="http://bitheap.org/dnuos/">Dnuos</a>. If the bitrate is labeled incorrectly on your torrent, your torrent may be deleted if reported.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.5"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.5">2.1.5.</a> <strong>Albums must not be ripped or uploaded as a single track.</strong> If the tracks on the original CD were separate, you must rip them to separate files. Clearly, CDs with single tracks are permitted to be uploaded without prior splitting. You are encouraged to use <a href="http://musicutter.szm.sk/">MusiCutter</a> or <a href="http://mpesch3.de1.cc/mp3dc.html">MP3DirectCut</a> for MP3 and <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=CueTools">CUE Tools</a>, <a href="http://tmkk.hp.infoseek.co.jp/xld/index_e.html">XLD</a>, or <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">EAC</a> for lossless if you need to split up an album image into individual tracks. <u>Exceptions</u>: Gapless DJ or professional mixes released as MP3+CUE images are allowed as unseparated album images on the site. This includes scene DJ mixes. No other format is allowed in this unsplit form. Unsplit MP3 albums containing separate tracks are not allowed if missing a cue sheet.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.6"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.6">2.1.6.</a> <strong>All music torrents must be encoded with a single encoder using the same settings.</strong> This means you cannot create a torrent which contains both CBR and VBR files, nor can you upload torrents containing a mix of APS (VBR)/-V2 (VBR) and APX (VBR)/-V0 (VBR). Including other kinds of audio quality, such as duplicate lossy files in a lossless torrent is also prohibited. This kind of release is referred to as a "mutt rip."
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.7"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.7">2.1.7.</a> <strong>Use only the allowed container formats for audio files.</strong> Use .m4a and .mp4 for AAC, and .ogg for Vorbis only. All other formats should not be encapsulated in containers. (e.g. FLAC must not be in an Ogg container, MP3 must not be in an .m4a container, and so forth.) <u>Exceptions</u>: DTS CD-sourced audio rips, although contained in WAV, should have the .dts extension.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.8"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.8">2.1.8.</a> <strong>Music not sourced from vinyl must not contain pops, clicks, or skips.</strong> They will be deleted for rip/encode errors if reported. Music that is sourced from vinyl must not have excessive problems.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.9"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.9">2.1.9.</a> <strong>Freely available music is allowed.</strong> Music uploaded may be freely available on the web (come from official sources such as record label, band websites, or the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Internet Archive</a>). Uploads can come from other torrent sites, but you take responsibility for determining the music is not transcoded. You are highly encouraged to include a link to the original host site or a note about the source for freely available files. However, this is not required and not grounds for reporting a torrent if missing such a link. All freely available music must conform to quality rules and formatting rules. This means it must be tagged correctly, not be a transcode, be separate tracks, and so forth. Freely available music uploads should have the "WEB" media format if no other source media (e.g. CD, DVD, etc.) can be established for the files.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.10"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.10">2.1.10.</a> <strong>Label water-marked or voice-over releases clearly.</strong> Watermarks or voice-overs must be clearly indicated in the torrent description. The torrent will be deleted for quality misrepresentation if not noted.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.11"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.11">2.1.11.</a> <strong>Radio, television, web rips and podcasts are not allowed.</strong> It does not matter whether it's FM, direct satellite, internet, or even if it's a pre-broadcast tape. It's too difficult for staff to moderate such things. Radio does not have enough bandwidth to meet our 192kbps rule. Anything on the radio has already gone through several conversions or re-encodes. <em>Note: Do not confuse web rips for WEB. The "WEB" media label on the upload page is for digital downloads, and has nothing to do with web rips.</em>

			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.12"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.12">2.1.12.</a> <strong>No unofficial audience recordings.</strong> Unofficially-mastered audience recordings (AUD) are not allowed here regardless of how rare you think they are. These include recordings on bootleg labels and those mastered by fans or traders. Unofficial IEM (In Ear Monitor), ALD (Assistive Listening Device), Mini-Disc, and Matrix-sourced recordings are also not allowed. None of those are pure soundboard quality either. <u>Exceptions</u>: Officially-remastered AUD/IEM/ALD/Mini-Disc/Matrix recordings are allowed. These may be re-appropriated recordings released with the artist's or their label's consent. Bonus tracks from such recording sources are also exempt since the tracks are released officially with the album.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.13"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.13">2.1.13.</a> <strong>Tape (VHS, Video-8, etc.) music sources are not suitable for this site.</strong> The frequency range is not good enough to meet the high quality we strive to maintain here. Hi-fi formats of tapes, such as Hi-Fi VHS, have good frequency range above regular standards (near CD quality at times). However, none of these sources are allowed on the site for moderation reasons.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.14"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.14">2.1.14.</a> <strong>Cassettes are allowed under strict conditions.</strong> Rare releases <em>available only on cassette</em> may be uploaded under strict special conditions. Cassette-sourced uploads must be approved by staff first. You must contact a <a href="staff.php">moderator</a> privately for approval before uploading. Include proof in the form of discography information from a reputable source as well as <a href="forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1200">spectrals</a> of 2 songs in your message. Staff reserves the right to refuse any badly-done cassette rips. Staff will immediately reject any cassette sources with poor lineage such as Audience recordings, bootlegs, or multi-generational rips. Unapproved cassette torrents may be reported and will be deleted if no note exists of prior staff approval. Anyone found found falsifying staff notes will have their uploading privileges removed.

Those should be compressed with multichannel FLAC. <em>Note: DTS-CD rips cannot be re-compressed to a lossless codec and they must be kept as WAV files with the .dts extension.</em>

			<li id="r2.1.16"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.16">2.1.16.</a> <strong>SACD hybrid rip sources must be properly labeled.</strong> SACD hybrid discs ripped from the CD layer should be labeled as CD and not SACD. If you used your CD/DVD drive and a CD ripper (such as <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">EAC</a>) to extract the audio, then label it as "CD" source (i.e. it's not true 24-bit). If the rip came from the genuine digital SACD layer through a SACD player mod or line out, it should be 24-bit quality SACD. You may include "SACD Hybrid" in the <em>Edition Information</em> box on the <a href="upload.php">upload page</a>.

			<li id="r2.1.17"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.17">2.1.17.</a> <strong>WEB media is for digital downloads only.</strong> Digital downloads released only on the internet from internet sources cannot be given the CD media label on the upload page. This includes downloads from the iTunes Store, LiveDownloads, Beatport, Amazon.com, Rhapsody, and other webstores. Scene releases with no information of sources must also be labeled as WEB. Freely available music with no source information must also be labeled WEB. If possible, indicate the source of your files (e.g. webstore) in the torrent description. You are responsible that the downloaded files conform to What.CD's rules for music quality. <em>Note: Do not confuse WEB for web rips. WEB media torrents are not always web rips (<a href="wiki.php?action=article&amp;id=14">transcodes</a>). Please check the spectrals before assuming they are web rips.</em>

			<li id="r2.1.18"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.18">2.1.18.</a> <strong>User-made compilations are not allowed.</strong> Compilations must be reasonably official. For example, "34 of my favourite Grateful Dead songs" is not a reasonably official collection. Compiling a release from a list, such as a Top 100 Billboard Chart, is not allowed. User-made and unofficial multichannel mixes are also not allowed. <u>Exceptions</u>: Bootlegs are allowed if they meet quality standards for music and are proven to be retail releases in digital or physical form. Bootlegs/mixtapes assembled and available from internet-only sources (e.g. music blogs, message boards, etc.) are not considered official enough for this site.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.19"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.19">2.1.19.</a> <strong>No comedy, audio books, or spoken word releases may be uploaded in the music category.</strong> Spoken word releases are governed by a different set of standards than music. Thus they do not belong in the music category.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.20"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.20">2.1.20.</a> <strong>Sound sample packs must be uploaded to the Applications category.</strong> These releases are allowed only under the apps category; they are forbidden in music and other categories. Sound sample packs may use formats other than those allowed for music, and must be official collections. <a href="#r3.1.8">See 3.1.8.</a> for more information.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.1.21"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.21">2.1.21.</a> <strong>All music torrents must represent a complete album (a complete collection release).</strong> Albums must not be missing tracks, or discs in the case of a multi-disc release. All music torrents must be one release. If an album is released as a multiple set of CDs, then it must be uploaded as a single torrent. Uploading each disc separately is not allowed. Digital downloads of albums must consist of entire albums. If tracks are available separately, but not released as singles, you may not upload them individually. <u>Exceptions</u>: Bonus discs may be uploaded separately in accordance with <a href="http://what.cd/rules.php?p=upload#r2.2.15">this rule</a>. Please note that individual bonus tracks are not allowed to be uploaded without the rest of the album. Bonus tracks are not bonus discs. Enhanced audio CDs with data or video tracks must be uploaded without the non-audio tracks. If you want to share the videos or data, you may host the files off-site with a file sharing service and include the link in your torrent description.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.22"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.22">2.1.22.</a> <strong>Multi-album torrents are not allowed on the site under any circumstances.</strong> That means no discographies, Pitchfork compilations, etc. Discographies make it a hassle for users to download individual albums. They result in a lot of duplicate albums being uploaded and are generally very poor quality. If releases (e.g. CD singles) were never released bundled together, do not upload them together. Live SBD material should be one torrent per night, per show, or per venue. Including more than one show in a torrent results in a multi-album torrent. <u>Exceptions</u>: Only official boxsets and official compilation collections can contain multiple albums.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.1.23"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.23">2.1.23.</a> <strong>Edition Information must be provided for digitally-sourced torrents.</strong> Digitally-sourced (including CD-sourced) rips of material first released before the availability of their source medium must have accurate edition information. For example, if a CD rip of an album whose original release date was 1957, predating the creation and distribution of CDs, then the uploader must make note of the correct year the CD was pressed, and preferably catalog identification as well. Rips for which Edition Information cannot be provided must be marked as an 'Unknown Release'. Under no circumstances must you guess or feign Edition Information.
			</li>		
			<li id="r2.1.24"><a href="#h2.1"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.1.24">2.1.24.</a> <strong>Downsampling of analog rips is allowed.</strong> Analog rips that have been downsampled may be uploaded (e.g. a 24/96 vinyl rip downsampled to 16/44). Any downsampled torrents must include the specific programs and methods used to downsample in addition to the lineage for the original rip or it will be deleted. <i>NOTE: downsampling of CDs is expressly forbidden.</i>

			<p style="text-align:center">
					<img src="static/common/trumpchart.png" alt="Audio Dupe and Trump Chart" />					<br /><em>This chart is an overview of how the dupe and trump rules work.</em>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.1"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.1">2.2.1.</a> <strong>Upload an allowed format if it doesn't exist on the site.</strong> If there is no existing torrent of the album in the format you've chosen, you can upload it in any bitrate that at least averages 192kbps.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.2.2"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.2">2.2.2.</a> <strong>Same bitrates and formats of the same releases are duplicates.</strong> If a torrent is already up in the format and bitrate you want to upload it in, you are not allowed to upload it&ndash;it's a duplicate (dupe). So if there's a 192kbps CBR MP3 version on the site, you are not allowed to upload another 192kbps CBR MP3. You cannot trump an existing torrent with a version that includes album art. <u>Exceptions:</u> Different editions and source media do not count as dupes. Refer to <a href="#r2.2.6">rule 2.2.6.</a> for more information.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.3"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.3">2.2.3.</a> <strong>Report all trumped and duplicated torrents.</strong> If you trump a torrent or notice a duplicate torrent, please use the report link (RP) to notify staff for removal of the old or duplicate torrent. This especially applies to lossless rips. If you are uploading a superior rip to the current one in the same format on the site, report the older torrent and include a link to your torrent in the report. Your torrent will be deleted as a dupe if the older torrent is not reported. <em>Note: Trump = You can trump a torrent that exists on the site by uploading a torrent in a preferred bitrate or quality as specified in the rules below. A torrent that is trumped by another torrent is considered a duplicate ("dupe") of the superior torrent, since the two torrents are not allowed to coexist on the site.</em>

			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.4"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.4">2.2.4.</a> <strong>Dupe rules also apply against previous uploads.</strong> All of the following dupe rules concerning music formats in this section may apply to torrents uploaded before. For example, if you upload an album in 192kbps MP3, someone can upload the same album in 320kbps at a later date and trump your 192kbps MP3.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.5"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.5">2.2.5.</a> <strong>Scene and non-scene releases of the same release, bitrate, and format are dupes.</strong> The "scene" label does not make torrents unique from each other. If a scene -V2 (VBR) of an album from CD is already uploaded, you may not upload another -V2 (VBR) of the same album from CD.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.2.6"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.6">2.2.6.</a> <strong>Different editions and source media count as separate releases.</strong> A rip from a different medium (e.g. vinyl) or release (e.g. a remaster) of an already existing torrent counts as a different release. The dupe rules do not apply between the two different edition torrents, nor two differently sourced torrents. So if a FLAC ripped from a CD is already up, you are still allowed to upload a FLAC ripped from vinyl. And if a 320kbps CBR MP3 release of an original mastering of an album was uploaded, you are still allowed to upload a 320kbps CBR MP3 remaster.
			</li>			
			<li id="r2.2.7"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.7">2.2.7.</a> <strong>Complete or untouched releases replace incomplete or watermarked versions.</strong> Watermarked promos containing voice-overs and similar can be trumped by a non-watermarked release. Releases missing hidden or pre-gap tracks can be replaced by proper rips that include the range. These hidden or pre-gap tracks should be in their own file, not appended to the beginning of track one, and releases where the hidden track or pre-gap is appended can be trumped by one where the track is a separate file.
			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.8"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.8">2.2.8.</a> <strong>Bonus disc-only uploads can co-exist with the complete set in accordance with the trumping rules.</strong>  A bonus disc-only release can be trumped by an upload containing the "full" original album + bonus discs, in the same format, in accordance with the <a href="http://what.cd/rules.php?p=upload#r2.2.15">usual trump rules</a>.
			</li>

			<li id="r2.2.9"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.9">2.2.9.</a> <strong>Higher bitrate CBR (Constant Bitrate) and ABR (Average Bitrate) torrents replace lower ones.</strong> Once a CBR (Constant Bitrate) rip has been uploaded, no CBR rips of that bitrate or lower can be uploaded. In the same manner, once an ABR (Average Bitrate) rip has been uploaded, no ABR rips of that bitrate or lower can be uploaded. For example, if a 320kbps CBR rip is already on the site, you are not allowed to upload a 256kbps CBR. ABR and CBR may be interchangeably trumped. A CBR can trump a lower bitrate ABR and an ABR may trump a lower bitrate CBR. You may not upload a 192kbps CBR if a 256kbps ABR of the same release is already up. 
			</li>
			<li id="r2.2.10"><a href="#h2.2"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.10">2.2.10.</a> <strong>Lossy format torrents with .log files do not replace equivalent existing torrents.</strong> If you want to upload a lossy format (e.g. MP3, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, etc.) with a log that already exists in the same medium and edition, you may not replace the current lossy torrent. For example, a -V2 (VBR) MP3 torrent with a log cannot replace a -V2 (VBR) without a log. Same applies for lossy audio torrents with .m3u, .cue, and other additions such as artwork. <u>Exceptions</u>: If an existing torrent contains encode/rip errors, you may upload another copy without errors. The bad torrent needs to be reported or yours will be deleted as a dupe. Also, <a href="#r2.3.8">see rules 2.3.8 through 2.3.16</a> for replacing badly named and tagged torrents.

					<li id="r2.2.11.1"><a href="#r2.2.11"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.11.1">2.2.11.1.</a> <strong>Only one lossy vinyl rip in a specific bitrate is allowed per release.</strong> Once someone has uploaded a lossy-format vinyl rip (in MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC), you may not upload another copy in the same bitrate. It does not matter whether if the lossy files are of a different sample rate found on the site. For example, if a 48 kHz -V2 (VBR) copy is already up, you may not upload the same album in -V2 (VBR) at 44.1 kHz.
					</li>
					<li id="r2.2.11.2"><a href="#r2.2.11"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.11.3">2.2.11.3.</a> <strong>Only one lossless and one 24bit lossless vinyl rip is allowed per edition.</strong> A poor sounding lossless rip may be trumped by a better sounding lossless rip, regardless of lineage information. The same quality trump can occur for 24bit lossless rips. To trump a rip for a better sounding version, you need to report it with clear informations about how your rip sounds better than the other one. Rips of extremely poor quality may be deleted outright if reported. All quality trumps/deletions of this nature are at the discretion of the moderator involved.
					</li>
					<li id="r2.2.11.3"><a href="#r2.2.11"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.2.11.4">2.2.11.4.</a> <strong>All vinyl torrents must be ripped at the correct speed.</strong> You must rip all vinyl at the speed they were intended to be played at.

So if a -V0 (VBR) is on the site, you may still upload a -V2 (VBR) or 320 CBR MP3 of the same release.

Furthermore, a -V2 (VBR) or APS (VBR) rip will trump all indiscriminate VBR rips of similar bitrate. A -V2 (VBR) rip will replace a 192 (VBR) rip or 210 (VBR) rip for example. Also, a -V2 (VBR) will replace a 192 (ABR) torrent.

Furthermore, a -V0 (VBR) or APX (VBR) rip will trump all indiscriminate VBR rips (of 192kbps average bitrate or higher). A -V0 (VBR) rip will replace a 256 (VBR) rip for example. You may not upload a -V1 (VBR) LAME encoding preset if either -V0 (VBR) or APX (VBR) are already present.

Note that soundboards, EPs, LPs. singles, special characters, and releases with various artists have special naming standards here. Use the <em>Edition Information</em> box on the <a href="upload.php">upload page</a> to denote different editions or versions of an album (e.g. censored version versus an uncensored version). Do not add genre tags like [Australia] or [K-Pop] to your album title. Those belong as <a href="rules.php?p=tag">Gazelle tags</a>.

Do not add additional information about the artist in the artist field unless the album credits the artist in that manner. For example, "Artist X (of Band Y)" or "Band X (feat. Artist Y)." It is recommended that you search existing torrents for the artist name so that you can be sure that you name the artist the exact same way. A torrent with a proper artist name will be grouped with the existing torrents on the artist page, and thus easy to find. Labeling the artist incorrectly prevents your torrent from being grouped with the other torrents of the same artist.

For example, all editions of <em>The Beatles (White Album)</em> would have 1968 in the main Year box. However, each of the various mono pressings, remasters, re-releases, expanded editions, reconstructions, etc. would have its respective release year in the <em>Edition Information</em> box.

Note that these must be substantial improvements such as the removal of garbage characters. Small changes such as diacritical marks are insufficient grounds for trumping. English translations of song titles in file names are encouraged, but not necessary for foreign language song titles. <u>Exceptions</u>: Rare albums featuring no track listing or untitled tracks may have file names like 01track.mp3, 02track.mp3, and so forth. Please note this tracklist in the <em>Album description</em>.

You may either place the tracks for each disc in a separate directory or number the tracks successively. You may place all the tracks for Disc One in one directory and all the tracks for Disc Two in another directory. If you prefer to use one directory for all the audio files, you must use successive numbering. Successive numbering may consist of the following (as illustrated with examples). Disc One has 15 tracks and Disc Two has 20. You may either number tracks in Disc One as #01-#15, and those of Disc Two as #16-#35 in the same directory. Or you may add a Disc number before the track numbers, such that the numbers are #1 06 for Disc One Track 06, and #2 03 for Disc 2 Track 03, and so forth. That way the track numbers will not be duplicated across multiple discs.

Make sure to use the proper format tags for your files (e.g. no ID3 tags for FLAC &ndash; see rule <a href="#r2.2.15.8">2.2.15.8</a>). ID3v2 tags for files are highly recommended over ID3v1. If you upload an album missing one or more of these tags, then another user may add the tags, re-upload, and report yours for deletion. The required tags are:
				<ul>

					<li>Artist</li>
					<li>Album</li>
					<li>Title</li>
					<li>Track Number.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Note: The "Year" tag is optional, but strongly encouraged. However, if missing or incorrect, is not grounds for trumping a torrent.</em></p>

Do not add the conductor or performer(s) to the composer's name as artist - you may add him/her/them at the end of the album title, though, in order to make it easier to distinguish between different recordings of the "same" work.

			<li id="r2.3.15"><a href="#h2.3"><strong>&uarr;_</strong></a> <a href="#r2.3.15">2.3.15.</a> <strong>Newly re-tagged torrents trumping badly tagged torrents must reflect a substantial improvement over the previous tags.</strong> Small changes that include replacing ASCII characters with proper foreign language characters with diacritical marks, fixing slight misspellings, or missing an alternate spelling of an artist (e.g. excluding "The" before a band name) are insufficient grounds for replacing other torrents. You may trump a release if the tags do not follow the data from a reputable music cataloging service such as <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">Musicbrainz</a> or <a href="http://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>. In case of conflict between reputable listings, either tagged version is equally preferred to the site and cannot trump the other. For example, an album is tagged differently in Musicbrainz and in Discogs. Either style of tagging is permitted; neither is "better" than the other. In that case, any newly tagged torrents replacing an already properly tagged torrent, which follows good tagging convention, will result in a dupe. <u>Exceptions</u>: Classical music has no easy tagging standard due to the incompatibilities with ID3 tag formats and classical meta data. Those may follow any standard as long as the tags are reasonable (i.e. not cut off, not misspelled beyond a few simple errors, not overly ambiguous, or uninformative). If you are not sure, you may follow guidelines at sites such as <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/ClassicalStyleGuide">MusicBrainz</a>, <a href="http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=70059">HydrogenAudio</a>, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/43791/2005/03/tagclass.html">this article</a>, or <a href="http://www.tunequest.org/on-classical-music-tagging-for-itunes-and-ipod/20060530/">this article</a>. <em>Note: <a href="http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/ClassicalStyleGuide">The MusicBrainz guide for classical tagging</a> may result in overly long tags, file names, and folder names. Some OSes (notably Windows), cannot read long folder and file names. It is advised to use it with ID3v2 and other tags that support long track names.
